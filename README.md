## Ad Click Classification

### Project Overview

This project aims to classify whether a user will **click on an ad** based on their demographic and behavioral data. By analyzing features such as `User ID`, `Gender`, `Age`, and `EstimatedSalary`, the goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict ad clicks. This is a foundational task in digital marketing and ad targeting.

### Technical Highlights

  * **Dataset**: [Kaggle - CVD CVD VD](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahnveenarang/cvdcvd-vd) (The provided code uses 'Social\_Network\_Ads.csv', which is a common dataset for this task).
  * **Size**: 400 entries, 5 columns.
  * **Key Features**:
      * `Gender`, `Age`, `EstimatedSalary`.
  * **Approach**:
      * **Data Cleaning**: The `User ID` column was dropped as it's a unique identifier. No missing values or duplicates were found.
      * **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The code checks basic statistics, null values, duplicates, and unique values for all columns.
      * **Label Encoding**: Applied to the `Gender` column to convert it to a numerical format.
      * **Binary Classification**: The target variable `Purchased` indicates whether the user clicked on the ad (`1`) or not (`0`).
      * **Models Used**:
          * Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Decision Tree.
  * **Best Accuracy**:
      * **91.3%** with Random Forest Classifier and Bagging Classifier.
      * **90.0%** with AdaBoost Classifier.
      * **88.8%** with Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier.

### Purpose and Applications

  * **Predict ad click-through rates** for online marketing campaigns.
  * Optimize ad targeting strategies by identifying the most receptive user segments.
  * Assist businesses in allocating advertising budgets more effectively.
  * Provide a foundational model for personalized advertising and recommendation systems.

### Collaboration

We welcome contributions to improve the project. You can help by:

  * Performing comprehensive hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for all models to achieve optimal performance.
  * Exploring more advanced feature engineering, such as binning the `Age` or `EstimatedSalary` columns.
  * Investigating alternative preprocessing methods, such as `StandardScaler`, and comparing their impact on model performance.
  * Adding explainability (e.g., SHAP or LIME) to understand which user demographics are the most significant drivers of ad clicks.
